# ImageCaptionGenerator-LSTM-CNN
Designed and implemented an Image Caption Generator by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data processing. This project aimed to bridge computer vision and natural language processing domains to automatically generate descriptive captions for images.
